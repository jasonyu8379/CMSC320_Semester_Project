We have chosen these datasets in order to analyze the sociopolitical trends in the United States surrounding the most recent election, so that we can get a better, data-driven understanding of our current society and politics at the national level. We are also interested in how these dynamics have changed between the 2020 and 2024 Presidential elections, so we are including both datasets.
