We have chosen the 2024 Time Series Study from the American National Election Survey
Citation:
American National Election Studies. 2025. ANES 2024 Time Series Study Full Release [dataset and documentation]. August 8, 2025 version. www.electionstudies.org

We have chosen this dataset in order to analyze the sociopolitical trends in the United States displayed surrounding the most recent election, so that we can get a better, data-driven understanding of our current society and politics at the national level.
